## Description:
The program is a scientific calculator implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It offers a wide range of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, and more. Users can input expressions using the graphical interface or keyboard and obtain results with high precision. The calculator supports both standard and scientific modes, providing versatility for various mathematical tasks.

## Usage:
Users can launch the calculator and interact with it using the graphical interface. They can input numbers and perform operations using the buttons provided. Additionally, users can switch between standard and scientific modes to access advanced mathematical functions.

## Packages/Libraries Used:
- Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
- Math: For mathematical functions like sqrt, cos, sin, etc.
- tkinter.messagebox: For displaying messages and handling user interactions.

## Installation Instructions:
Since Tkinter is a standard Python library, no additional installation steps are required for most Python installations. However, if Tkinter is not installed or if you encounter any issues, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## Instructions to Run the Program:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. If Tkinter is not installed, install it using the provided pip command.
3. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `test.py`).
4. Run the Python file using the Python interpreter:

test.py

5. The calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform mathematical calculations using the provided interface.
